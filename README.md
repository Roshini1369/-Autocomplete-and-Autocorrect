 Autocomplete and Autocorrect
 Autocomplete & Autocorrect Data Analytics (NLP Project)
This project explores the functionality, performance, and effectiveness of autocomplete and autocorrect algorithms using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

🚀 Project Objectives
Implement basic text preprocessing and tokenization.

Build an n-gram language model for word prediction (autocomplete).

Develop an autocorrect system using edit distance (Levenshtein).

Combine both systems to enhance user typing assistance.

Perform simple performance analysis on predictions.

📂 Features
🧼 Preprocessing: Clean and tokenize large textual datasets.

🔍 Autocomplete: Suggest next words using trigram (n-gram) language models.

🧠 Autocorrect: Detect and correct misspelled words based on edit distance.

⚙️ Custom Prompt Assistant: Corrects misspellings and predicts next word.

📊 Expandable: Framework can be extended with deep learning or Transformer models.

📊 Technologies Used
Python

NLTK

Textdistance (for autocorrect)

Collections & Regex

(Optional) Gradio/Streamlit for UI

📝 Example Usage

prompt = "she was definately"
corrections, prediction = smart_typing_assist(prompt, trigram_model, vocabulary)
print("Autocorrect:", corrections)
print("Predicted next word:", prediction)
